# Welcome to the Bible Learning App
I wanted to create an app to make it easier for people to understand the Bible.

I grew up in China. When I came to the U.S. for college in central Missouri , I attended a Chinese church every Friday evening because they offered free dinner and took us to Walmart for groceries. People were so kind to me—it quickly became my favorite activity of the week. It was also my first encounter with Christianity. I was told that if I wanted to learn more, I should start by reading the Bible.

After returning to my dorm, I opened the book. The first page read something like, "This person is the son of this person, and that person is the son of that person..." As someone who spends a lot of time solving logical problems, I sometimes struggle to stay focused while reading. The Bible holds so many valuable lessons, but some passages can be difficult to get through.

The goal of this app is to make the Bible easier to understand for everyone—with the help of AI—regardless of your reading proficiency. Feel free to message me with feature requests!
